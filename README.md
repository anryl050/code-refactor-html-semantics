# Improving of the Code Accessibility for Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc.
## Project Description
Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. is a marketing agency that specializes in the search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. It offers its clients solutions with load generations, brand awareness and cost management.
 As a marketing agency, Horiseon Social Solutions Services, Inc. needed to improve its website’s accessibility standards to optimize it for the search engines.
Website optimization involved the following:
- Additon of a meaningful title.
-	HTML code was refactored following the semantic structure. 
o	The website’s functionality and appearance were not impacted by the optimization of the codebase.
-	The HTML code was updated to follow logical structure independent of styling and positioning requirements.
-	The duplicate/redundant code within HMTL and CSS style sheet was consolidated and/or removed to improve the existing flow of the code.
Besides optimizing the existing codebase to improvement website’s accessibility standards, an image descriptor (alternate text) was added to every meaningful image within the website. Addition of the alternate text to the images allows users with disabilities to access and use the website, as well as allowing the website to rank higher in the search engines (which brings higher visibility to the website and attracts potential clients). 
## Technology Used
The website was built using HMTL and CSS programing languages.
